When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To share code, contribute to another project's code, accept other contributions to my local code or having a safe backup for the most important parts of my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- There may be changes that i don't want to accept yet...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- When you clone, you copy a whole repository to your own working directory. Whereas by fork, you create a similar repository on your remote directory. Branches are only labels that can be present both in working directory/staging area and/or remote directory.
