When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To share code, contribute to another project's code, accept other contributions to my local code or having a safe backup for the most important parts of my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be changes that i don't want to accept yet...
