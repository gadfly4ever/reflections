What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden meta-data in a .git directory is created. To tell git that there are things to commit!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Statging area contains the files ready to be committed, repository committed files and working directory all the files in the repository...

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Committing each change in staging area at once?!!..
